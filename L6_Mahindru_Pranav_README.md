Lab 6
This is an individual Lab 6 Assignment that was done by me and I didn't take any reference other than Lab 6 documents and recordings and few thing are taken from the lab 7 recordings
As per the document i install the create-react-app and change in the boilerplate in App.js, i remove all code after I install create-react-app. 

I put my own code and also use components such as description and button and also make the json Data under Components. 
In the App.js the code is done by me and didn't take any code from outside, i took reference from lab 6 and lab 7 recording. 
I also change the folder structure i put the app.css and index.css under the css and also i wrote my own css, I didn't take from outside.
