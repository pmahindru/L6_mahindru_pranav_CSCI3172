Lab 6

This is an individual Lab 6 Assignment that was done by me and I didn't take any reference from outside other than i just saw the Lab 6 and Lab 7 recordings

As per the I install the create-react-app and change in the boilerplate in App.js, after I install create-react-app and remove all code in App.js. 

I put my code in App.js and also make components such as description, button and json Data under Components folder. 

I also change the folder structure i put the app.css and index.css under the css folder and also i wrote my own css in the app.css, button.css, description.css, I didn't take code/reference from the outside. I took reference from Lab 6 and Lab 7 recordings
